    description= _ "Any Steppe Orcs wishing to lead their comrades must first show their worth in battle. Spearheads lead the charge into the enemy, seeking to crash a hole in the battle lines of the foe. It is a dangerous profession to say the least. Their eagerness to impress frequently results in a sticky end. Their crude but often effective tactics are complemented by equally crude but effective weapons. A weight attached to a chain makes a perfectly serviceable flail."
