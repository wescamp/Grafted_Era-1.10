Undead vs Nightmares of Meloen

Having to fight Nightmares is one to the toughest experience for Undead. Unlike what they are used to, Undead in this matchup will play by counter-attack as the ability of make most damage is not on their side. While you will be relatively safe on the ranged front, the <i>Unhatched</i>'s impact will break his <i>Skeletons</i> in piece, the <i>Life Thief</i>'s arcane will tear them appart while the cheap <i>Creepers</i>' banding is an additional threat to your <i>Dark Adepts</i>. So you will have to turn on the survival mode as soon as possible, recruiting <i>Ghoul</i>, <i>Ghost</i>, <i>Walking Corpse</i>, still some <i>Skeletons</i> and <i>Dark Adept</i> for the counter.

Always keep a decent amount of <i>Dark Adepts</i> on the board in order to keep Nightmares under pressure. This way you will be ruling on the ranged as they will rule on the melee part. As you will unlikely face the threat of <i>Life Thieves</i> in the begining, you will have to deal with <i>Unhatched</i> first by recruiting <i>Walking Corpses</i> to contain them. While your <i>Walking Corpses</i> begin taming the <i>Unhatched</i>, Nightmares will send more <i>Life Thieves</i>. Try to make them attack your <i>Skeletons</i> as if they get wounded, they will become an easy job for your <i>Dark Adepts</i>. 

It is quite sure that at a certain moment, as your <i>Walking Corpses</i> starts getting annoying, Nightmares will recruit <i>Creepers</i>. As level 0 units, they are quite a natural opposition for the <i>Walking Corpses</i>, however they require some special techniques to deal with them. <i>Creepers</i> have a neutral alignment so you better fight them at night as two hits will be enough to kill them (they won't get plagued). As the band to inflict maximum damage you should always try to attack the most isolated ones, if you really need to kill one in the pack, better use the <i>Skeleton</i> as he resists strongly their pierce.

<u>Dark Adept:</u> again, the <i>Dark Adept</i> will be your best unit for attacking. The threat of the <i>Unhatched</i>'s charge will be the major challenge, as three hits are enough to kill them at night. When they are in position to attack they should hit the <i>Unhatched</i> first as they will do maximum damage against them. The second best choice being the <i>Life Thief</i>. Try to pick your target so your <i>Dark Adept</i> can take the shoot from good defense or make sure you can cover him immediately.

<u>Ghost:</u> with drains on its arcane melee, the <i>Ghost</i> can enjoy this matchup. It is efficient against the <i>Unhatched</i>, the <i>Scornful watcher</i>, the <i>Unstable Elemental</i> at to a lesser extend the <i>Creepers</i>. Its only problem will be when facing full health <i>Life Thieves</i>. As the <i>Ghost</i> has worst resistance, less hitpoints and doesn't hit as hard, it should not engage in direct fight with them. Hopefully it can rely on its better movement points to make sure to keep far enough, as long as it doesn't get slowed by the bramble form of the <i>Unstable Elemental</i>.

<u>Ghoul:</u> the <i>Ghoul</i> is an important unit in this matchup. That is the best candidate for holding village against <i>Unhatcheds</i> with its poison and <i>Life Thieves</i> with its relative resistance to arcane. He can also poison <i>Unstable Elemental</i> to force them to heal, depriving Nightmares of support units.

<u>Skeleton:</u> its is a good support unit against Nightmares. As it certainly fears the <i>Unhatched</i>'s impact and <i>Life Thief</i>'s arcane melee, he can cause enough damage to make its sacrifice worthwile. While the <i>Skeleton</i> can help clearing <i>Creepers</i> out of the way, it is not worth putting it on bad defense terrain for that as the Nightmares' counter will hurt him badly. It is also the best weapon against <i>Black Cat</i> and <i>Scornful Watcher</i> if they are present on the field but it is not worth to feed it with kills, better use a <i>Walking Corpse</i> to plague them.

<u>Skeleton Archer:</u> do not recruit any <i>Archer</i>, they are made of the kind of bones <i>Unhatched</i> likes to play with. At any time of the day, the <i>Unhatched</i> will be attracted by them and his impact charge attack will destroy them within the second. There is no way the <i>Skeleton Archer</i> can make enough damage before dying to repay its gold.

<u>Vampire Bat:</u> even the hax power of the <i>Bat</i> is not enough to save them against the charge of an <i>Unhatched</i>. Any bat is killed in two hits and the intelligent ones are dead in one single hit at night. If you got one, use it to steal village or disrupt Nightmares' orginization. But stay away from <i>Unhatcheds</i> and <i>Scornful Watchers</i> at all time.

<u>Walking Corpse:</u> the use of <i>Walking Corpse</i> is mainly for obstructing, screening off <i>Dark Adepts</i> and <i>Skeleton</i> from their foes. You can also place them around units that are holding a position to reduce the number of spots available for attack. On attack, they should focus on <i>Creepers</i> and <i>Unhatched</i>.
