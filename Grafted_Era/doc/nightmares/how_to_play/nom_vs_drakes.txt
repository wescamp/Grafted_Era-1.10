Nightmares of Meloen vs Drakes

Unless you got a <i>Life Thief</i> right on, it is likely that your first recruit will be a little backward what is truly needed against the Drakes. Still, your <i>Unhatched</i> units should be put to good use as they still deal a good amount of damages at night. After acknowledging your opponent's faction, you should start getting a few more <i>Howling Darkness</i> and <i>Life Thief</i> units as they both have a damage type the drakes are weak too. If you got a <i>Watcher</i>, do not worry too much, your opponent is likely to have gotten a few saurian units on their first recruit, thus your <i>Watcher</i> will still have his role to play.

More than in most match-ups, this one will use heavily the Time of Day cycle as your opponent will unlikely base his strategy around saurians, and will make heavy use of <i>Burners</i>. This will lead to a match between quick and hard hitting units with opposite alignments. Do not fear to leave your villages at day, you will get them back as the night falls.

<u>Unhatched:</u> Although the Drakes will resist his impact damage a bit, this unit will remain damage/cost efficient, and a good option to bring the <i>Burners</i> down or other units at favorable Time of Day and/or with a <i>Howling Darkness</i> support. Also, on favorable terrain they'll be your cheapest option to block an attack and let your expensive damage dealer safe, if you really have to hold a point or cover an important unit. Try to have a couple around any time.

<u>Black Cat:</u> the <i>Cat</i> won't be as much of use as in other match-ups, as the drakes don't suffer defense alteration as much as the high-def units. Still, it can be of use against the saurian and any cheap shot to lower a drake defense is cool to take. No need to recruit several of them. 

<u>Life Thief:</u> they really are a core troop in the matchup against Drakes. Their damage type ensures heavy damage against any of them, in addition to the fact they'll replenish life as they fight. Always have a couple of them around, but be aware that at daytime the fire damage of Drakes will tear them apart.

<u>Scornful Watcher:</u> It is likely that the only saurians you'll face are those from your opponent's first recruit. Poking at the <i>Skirmishers</i>, or finishing and retaliating against <i>Augurs</i> is the only use of this unit, so don't recruit it if you know you're against the Drakes faction.

<u>Howling Darkness:</u> While a casual support unit elsewhere, the <i>Darkness</i> is a necessity against the Drakes. His cold damage type makes it efficient against anything, his horror ability will make your push safer, and his skirmishing ability will help to ZoC the hard-to-trap Drakes when comes the night. You need a couple of them around.

<u>Unstable Elemental:</u> The scouting role will be fill by your <i>Darkness</i> units already, so the <i>Elemental</i> will be less of use here. It can still get the iffy slots you don't want your <i>Darkness</i> to take, and hopping on a hill/mountain or a water hex to tank can remain a decent option if you have to protect your more important damage dealers. Don't recruit more than one.

<u>Creeper:</u> Although dealing piercing damage, the amount isn't enough to benefit from the Drakes' pierce weakness. So no need to focus on that point. More over, its low movement and grouping constraint will make it unable to follow the day/night push'n pull of this match-up. If the game goes for a stalemate though, because of an heavy damage threat on each side or defensive styleplay, they can become an option.
