Nightmares of Meloen vs Loyalists

After having got a general purpose recruitment on turn 1, when realizing nightmares of Meloen are facing Loyalists, they want to get <i>Scornful Watcher</i>. Their arcane focus special is using loyalists' arcane resistance at their detriment. The <i>Scornful Watcher</i> is rather fragile on melee though and you need to protect at any time of the day. The <i>Unhatched</i> is usually used for that job as it is quite cheap and thus does not divert too much resource from the <i>Scornful Watcher</i> recruitment.

<u>Unhatched:</u> get enough of those to protect your weaker units. They can engage in combat with any ranged unit and melee unit too if you make full use of <i>Unhatched</i>'s trait. Exception for the <i>Heavy Infantry</i> that should not be attacked directly for fear of hard retaliation.

<u>Black Cat:</u> get one or two of them to lower opponent's defence. Combined with heavy hitters <i>Unhatched</i> and <i>Watcher</i> they garantee maximal damage. They can be use for village holding too if the number of attacker is limited.

<u>Life Thief:</u> don't recruit those against Loyalist as their unit's all have good arcane resistance to counter his melee attack.

<u>Scornful Watcher:</u> when facing Loyalist, this is showtime for the <i>Watcher</i>. You have to recruit enough of them to do plenty of damage at night but make sure you can cover them when the day comes. You should consider feeding them XP so to use the level 2 at his full potential.

<u>Howling Darkness:</u> you can recruit one of those to help the <i>Unhatched</i> to clear the way for <i>Watchers</i> without taking too much retaliation. His own ranged attack can be of some help to weaken units that don't resist cold. Timing his attack is important because as soon as he has fired, you can't use his skirmisher for further support.

<u>Unstable Elemental:</u> recruit some of them zocing out your opponent's troops at dawn and trap them in at dusk. When put in water they can restrain <i>Mermen</i>'s mobility, however they should not engage in combat due to their bad resistance. The <i>Unstable Elemental</i> can also help holding the line when put on hill or forest. In the later terrain, the slow special can keep the mages away and their pierce resist can hold the spearmen.

<u>Creeper:</u> you can use some of them to hurt mages, archers or horses. When your time of the day is done, you can also use them to shield more important units by forcing your opponent to use some unit to clear them out. Keep them in pack to lower upkeep.
