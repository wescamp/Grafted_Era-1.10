Loyalists vs Nightmares of Meloen

When Loyalists realizes he faces Nightmares of Meloen, his attention should constantly be focused on the <i>Scornful Watcher</i>. The large range of Loyalists' melee units can be used to bring them down before night. As your opponent will try his best as zocing you out from getting at his <i>Watchers</i>, recruiting a bit of any melee units is one important step to ruin his strategy.

While the <i>Spearman</i> gets the best damage per gold, he is quite easily controlled by the <i>Unhatched</i>. Hence you should have some <i>Cavalryman</i> to attack from the distance, moreover his good impact resistance can make him a good blocker against the <i>Unhatched</i>.

While when attacking <i>Unhatched</i> with <i>Mage</i> you should try to finish from fear that Nightmares might sacrifice him on your <i>Mage</i> hoping for a kill, for any other attack combo, the most important is to deal maximum damage. As the Nightmares don't really have an efficient village holder, they will have to give up villages reducing their ability to heal. The only exception is the <i>Scornful Watcher</i> as he is so deadly that you want to have him dead.

<u>Bowman:</u> the <i>Bowman</i> is less efficient at dealing damage to Nightmares than the <i>Mage</i>. For this reason you should restrain yourself from getting them. However, if you lack of gold or if you already have one, it can be quite useful against the <i>Live Thief</i> and the <i>Unhatched</i> or against the <i>Scornful Watcher</i> at retaliating. His additional hitpoints can be a life saver.

<u>Cavalryman:</u> this is a key unit for this matchup. His high resistance to impact damage helps containing the Nightmares push at night while his speed allows him to switch quickly to the attack mode on <i>Scornful Watchers</i>. The <i>Cavalryman</i> can also successfully chase down a fleeing <i>Howling Darkness</i> and you can use his 4 strikes to nearly guarantee a hit on the <i>Black Cat</i>. His blade damage is also doing well against the bramble form of the <i>Unstable Elemental</i>. So get some of them and try to level one.

<u>Fencer:</u> get them if wounded <i>Howling Darknesses</i> and <i>Scornful Watchers</i> keep escaping your grip. They will only have small use in defense, as the combination of <i>Black Cat</i>'s jinx attack and their own bad resistance are promises of short life when facing the <i>Unhatched</i>. If you have no problem killing your quota of <i>Scornful Watchers</i> you probably better keep the gold for a <i>Mage</i>.

<u>Heavy Infantry:</u> do only recruit them when Nightmares abuse of <i>Unhatcheds</i>. As soon as they appear, they will be the target of <i>Scornful Watchers</i> to clear the way for the <i>Unhatcheds</i>. As your <i>Heavy Infantry</i>'s armor is no use against them, you should make sure they are in <i>Scornful Watcher</i>'s range only at the second night otherwise you will probably lose too much gold. Due to their slowness, they will only be useful in defense so the best time to get recruit them is usually at dusk or first night. On attack they should target anything but the <i>Life Thief</i> whenever possible.

<u>Horseman:</u> while the <i>Horseman</i> powerful charge let's you hope of huge damage, its cost is a deterrent to having one in the early game. Money is better spend on another mage if you plan an attack. If the game gets longer and you succeed in cashing enough gold, you can then get one as he will do well at <i>Scornful Watcher</i> assassination with his impact resistance cutting down the retaliation.

<u>Mage:</u> the <i>Mage</i> will be your best weapon against the <i>Unhatched</i>. However, his low hitpoints require you to protect them at any time of the day. Hit the <i>Unhatched</i> you have the best chance to kill, as even wounded his charge attack is danger for your <i>Mage</i>'s life. As he is so weak against the <i>Unhatched</i>, don't feed them with kills as they will probably never live long enough to level.

<u>Merman Fighter:</u> when water is present in the map, getting a <i>Merman Fighter</i> or two is a good idea. As Nightmares don't have good movement on water, they can force the <i>Unstable Elemental</i> to move to water to control them or they will be able to reach the <i>Scornful Watchers</i>. When facing a whirlpool form of the <i>Unstable Elemental</i> do not fear to engage in combat as they have worst resistance than your <i>Merman Fighters</i>.

<u>Spearman:</u> as always, the spearman will be the first recruit to turn to. He can both retaliate hard on the <i>Unhatched</i>'s charges and do severe damage to the <i>Scornful Watcher</i>. His low price allows you to get enough to protect efficiently your <i>Mages</i> from the threat of <i>Unhatcheds</i>. Combining with <i>Cavalryman</i> is a must though, as you want to diversify your damage type to leverage on the resistance bonus of the <i>Unhatched</i>'s trait and get more speed to chase Nightmares down when the day comes.
