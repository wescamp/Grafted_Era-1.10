Nightmares of Meloen vs Northerners

The fight between these two chaotic factions will be relentless. As Nightmares' units are slightly weaker and more expensive, it will be theirs to decide when to retreat or heal a unit. If they failed to do so and try to match Northerners in a total war, it is likely that they will end up critically wounded and undermanned.

While the natural way for Nightmares of Meloen to fight against Northerners would be to use their abilities to make for Northerners' number, that strategy doesn't fare very well. Nightmares' best chance is to turn quickly to <i>Creepers</i>. Getting too many <i>Unhatched</i> will make the Northerners turn to <i>Whelps</i>. As Nightmares' <i>Life Thieves</i>, their best counter against trolls, can't beat them in price, that is not something they want to happen.

<u>Unhatched:</u> this time, basing your army around this unit won't be so safe : the <i>Troll Whelp</i> is most of the time quite efficient to counter it, charging <i>Grunts</i> is not often a good idea and the fire of <i>Orcish Archers</i> is efficient enough. Though it remains important to keep a few arounds because it remains an efficient <i>Wolf</i> and <i>Archer</i> killer and if the traits and the <i>Howling Darkness</i> are wisely used, could even charge occasionally <i>Grunts</i> or <i>Whelps</i>.

<u>Black Cat:</u> she is a vital unit to have to weaken defense of Northerners' melee units. Keep her on the best defense and don't leave Northerners too many spots to attack her as a <i>Grunt</i> only needs two hits to kill her at night. Even then, it will be <i>Grunts</i>' primary target, so Nightmares will have to regularly put her in their recruitment list as their <i>Black Cats</i> fall.

<u>Life Thief:</u> while it is a useful unit to face <i>Whelps</i> as he leverages on their arcane weakness, its low defense and lack of fire resistance makes it <i>Orcish Archer</i>'s favorite meal. However, recruiting it will force your opponent to invest in <i>Orcish Archers</i>, a unit that is more expensive and an easier prey for your <i>Unhatched</i>, because the other northerner troops will hardly deal with your <i>Life Thief</i> on their own. Still, it is more a unit to bring in the middle of the game after Nightmares have survived Orcs first assaults and Northerners move to an attrition warfare with <i>Whelps</i>.

<u>Scornful Watcher:</u> the safest fighter to poke at the <i>Grunts</i>. He deals good damage without retaliation. However as it still requires 6 or 7 hits to kill a <i>Grunt</i>, the support of <i>Black Cats</i> is necessary to inflict enough damage per turn to stand the flow of hordes of <i>Grunts</i>. His retaliation is also good enough to make cursed melee units think twice before attacking. However, because it is by far not as cost efficient as the <i>Grunts</i> here, they aren't enough to give you victory, and are only a part of the mix you need.

<u>Howling Darkness:</u> it can provide helpful support to attacks on melee and its range attack is very useful to finish off cursed <i>Grunts</i> or <i>Whelps</i>.  The <i>Howling Darkness</i> is also a very efficient helper when fighting <i>Nagas</i>. But as its survival hope is quite bleak against melee heavy Northerners, getting one at a time is enough. As it gets a nice health point boost on leveling, Nightmares might want to feed him with kills (a bit more than three kills needed to advance).

<u>Unstable Elemental:</u> this scout can find some room to fit in. It can be useful on water against <i>Naga</i> and can hold a hill or mountain for a while. The bramble form on forest, while it gets a nice slow special, is weak to <i>Grunt</i>'s blade. While the <i>Unstable Elemental</i> is very versatile, something is common to all forms: they can be poisoned.

<u>Creeper:</u> his lack of mobility is not a problem as both factions are chaotic, while his relatively high defense requires on average two <i>Grunts</i> to kill one at full health. They do a pretty lousy job at holding village against more than 2 units. <i>Creepers</i>' priority is to bring down the <i>Orcish Archers</i> on attack and cover healing units and <i>Watchers</i>. As they are of neutral alignment, wait for daytime to push them to attack when they will receive less retaliation. If they can be used to attack <i>Wolf Riders</i>, they should keep defensive for the other melee units. Keep the full health <i>Creepers</i> in front to maximise retaliation before they die. Try to manage your gold to recruit them by pack of at least three as power comes with number.

<u>Summary:</u>
Use Creepers on Orcish Archers and Black Cat and Scornful Watcher on Grunts. The Unhatched can at times be used to charge but you have to create good conditions of attack for him. If you really have to charge something, try to use the Floating Darkness to limit retaliation (unless you target an Archer), and keep in mind the traits. Charging Assassin is a good idea to get rid of the poison that turns your Unhatched into a joke. If you face an army of Trolls get some Life Thieves. If you can't, best is to just ignore Trolls unless you have a bunch of idle Creepers. Don't mind high defense spot (except for the Cat) as much as unit cover when moving.
