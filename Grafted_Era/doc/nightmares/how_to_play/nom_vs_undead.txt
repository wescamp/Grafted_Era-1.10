Nightmares of Meloen vs Undead

This matchup will be another total war for Nightmares. Facing another chaotic faction, there will be not much time to rest even if the pace of the game might get slower depending on the recruited lines.

As Nightmares realize they are facing Undead they will have most probably an edge to launch the first attack. As Undead's major tool to contain attack from Nightmares is the <i>Walking Corpse</i> and that this one is rarely recruited in the beginning of the game, there will be a window for Nightmares to strike first before Undead gets fully prepared. During that period, the <i>Unhatched</i> will be ruling the place raiding <i>Skeletons</i> and <i>Dark Adepts</i>.

As Undead starts building up its army of <i>Walking Corpses</i>, Nightmares will have to change his recruitment pattern toward <i>Life Thief</i> and <i>Creepers</i>. The <i>Life Thief</i> despite its high price will be an invaluable asset with its heavy arcane melee that hurts any undead. The <i>Creepers</i> will be necessary to match <i>Walking Corpses</i>' numbers.

<u>Unhatched:</u> one of Nightmares' most important weapons in this matchup. The <i>Unhatched</i>'s role is to focus on <i>Dark Adepts</i> and get them down before they inflict deadly strikes. Its charge is also very efficient depending on its trait at fighting skeletons despite the heavy retaliation at night. For these reasons, you should keep getting some after <i>Walking Corpses</i> are spreading. If they have to charge a <i>Walking Corpse</i>, make sure to pick one that can be killed in one hit as its retaliation will hurt hard.

<u>Black Cat:</u> as <i>Black Cat</i>'s special jinx is not affecting Undead, she has a too huge price for its limited power in this matchup and should not be recruited in numbers. If you have got one, use her to hunt <i>Bats</i>, weaken skeleton with magic before <i>Unhatched</i>'s assault or hold village.

<u>Life Thief:</u> with its arcane melee, the <i>Life Thief</i> will be the master of the battle, its only threat being the <i>Dark Adept</i>. While it will be inflicting damage all around, it will have very few opportunity to drain so it will have to retreat to heal. Don't let your blood lust make you forget it or you could lose all hopes to level.

<u>Scornful Watcher:</u> as most Undead's units have some arcane weakness, the <i>Scornful Watcher</i> doesn't play a significant role. The only exception is if Undead recruitment turns for <i>Ghouls</i> against who he is the best weapon. Otherwise, use your <i>Scornful Watcher</i> on <i>Bats</i> and <i>Ghosts</i>, or to defend against the <i>Dark Adept</i>. Getting <i>Scornful Watcher</i> to fight <i>Ghost</i> is a good idea if you can't afford getting a <i>Life Thief</i>.

<u>Howling Darkness:</u> its cold ranged attack is very inefficient against most Undead's units and its terror ability doesn't affect undead. For these reasons, refrain yourself from recruiting any <i>Howling Darkness</i>.

<u>Unstable Elemental:</u> it is good to have one of this quick unit on the board. As the tornado form, the fastest, is quite weak, it will be used mainly for scouting and remote village protection. The bramble form can also be of some help with two impact attacks and the slow special. All form being weak to arcane, it will be a target for the <i>Ghosts</i> that will heal on them with drain when they don't fear getting slowed.

<u>Creeper:</u> the <i>Creepers</i> are a good match to the <i>Walking Corpse</i>  with the advantage of not fearing to be plagued. They have less health points but hit harder when the banding ability is used well. Make sure you keep them in pack as the <i>Walking Corpses</i> will always target the most isolated ones. You should wait the end of the night to attack them as they will lose their chaotic bonus that allows them to kill your neutral <i>Creeper</i> in two hits. Keep in mind though to kill <i>Walking Corpse</i> when it clears access to a <i>Dark Adept</i>, and doing it at daytime would bring little benefit as your <i>Unhatched</i> will not hit that hard.
