Nightmares of Meloen vs Rebels

The <i>Unhatched</i> and <i>Black Cat</i> combination will shine on this match-up. The defense debuffing will negate the specialty of the nimble elves, and the hard hitting <i>Unhatched</i> will quickly rip off their little health amount. That will not be enough to give you the game in hand though : the cost efficient fighter can still do some nasty retaliation, even if your <i>Unhatched</i> has the appropriate trait, and the <i>Wose</i> is almost invincible against them. Therefore, you'll need a mix of support units to make up for it.

Your opponent will try to hold your night pushes mostly, capitalize experience by finishing off the units that took hard retaliation and wait to have regrouped a few <i>Woses</i> before attacking you at day. Try to seize the dynamic of the game in your favor with an early threat and have the push'n pull happen around his villages rather than yours. If he brings on too many <i>Woses</i>, counter recruit with your <i>Life Thief</i> units, and use the support of an <i>Howling Darkness</i> if too many fighters block the way.

<u>Unhatched:</u> They'll be your core troop here, dealing massive damage to the elves who are on bad terrain or under the effect of jinx, as well as taking the hits from swords and arrows. Have an army of them anytime but if you see <i>Wose</i> spam.

<u>Black Cat:</u> Another of your key units in this match. They won't deal many damage, but they'll have a massive impact on the Rebels' defense organization. Always have at least one, but you may recruit several as they'll be really busy cursing every unit around.

<u>Life Thief:</u> Their arcane damage will make them quite decent damage dealers against most of Rebels' troop. However they really shine at dealing with the <i>Wose</i>, and aren't as cost efficient as the <i>Unhatched</i> for the other jobs. So recruit according to the number of <i>Woses</i> you face.

<u>Scornful Watcher:</u> Because nearly all units it'll fight with are arcane weak, the <i>Scornful Watcher</i>'s special will lessen its potential. Still, the rounding of damages make it do a 7-3 ranged attack (at night only) making it a passable archer-like creature. It may deal with the human mage too in favorable conditions. You can have one around, but restrain from having more as your money is probably better spent elsewhere.

<u>Howling Darkness:</u> If you face packs of elves to counter your <i>Unhatched</i> army, its horror ability will be of good help to reduce retaliation. Moreover, its skirmishing capacity will make it efficient at ZoCing units, get on the extra hex you need for damage dealing, or even slip behind the lines to village threat, decoy, create open spaces and disorganize the Rebels' defense organization in general. It is quite an expensive unit though, so don't recruit several of it.

<u>Unstable Elemental:</u> The <i>Elemental</i> will have a vital role of scouting and gathering intelligence. It will also at times be able to tank in hills or grab the forest hexes your opponent would want. To finish with, its slowing special when coming out of a forest will ensure your <i>Unhatched</i> to take low retaliation even against the fighters. The unit isn't too damage/cost efficient though, so bear in mind that you decrease your fire power with each of them.

<u>Creeper:</u> Again, the <i>Creepers</i> will offer an alternative to your army, but they don't make a game on their own, especially since the <i>Wose</i> is about invincible against them. Go the <i>Creepers</i> way if you fight many elves that aren't willing to come for a fight.
