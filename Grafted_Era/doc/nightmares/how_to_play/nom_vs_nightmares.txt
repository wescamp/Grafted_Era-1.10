Nightmares of Meloen vs Nightmares

Like all mirror matches, this matchup requires to use units at their full potential to make a difference. The additional fun in this mirror is that you will make huge damaage at each turn is pretty high and that the number of potential targets is pretty high for most units.

When realizing you face other Nightmares, get more <i>Life Thieves</i>. As it has no real foe beside the <i>Scournful Watcher</i>, it will have a pretty easy life. The only thing to worry is to get slowed by a bramble form of the <i>Unstable Elemental</i> as that would make any <i>Scournful Watcher</i> around an immediate danger.

Move in the battlefield with <i>Life Thieves</i> first. While you should not let them get slowed, you can lure some foe in the open to charge him with <i>Unhatcheds</i>. When moving, the <i>Unhatched</i> will under constant pressure from opponent's <i>Life Thieves</i> so you should keep your <i>Scournful Watchers</i> in range to counter an attack (bramble form of the <i>Unstable Elemental</i> can do either).

In the case you face a spam of bramble form of the <i>Unstable Elemental</i>, make sure you attack them one after the other, feeding the same <i>Life Thief</i> with kills. The bramble forms lacks of attack power and even slowed <i>Life Thief</i> will heal enough on retaliation to survive. Putting your <i>Unhatched</i> on forest will deprive your opponent from the best spots and force him quickly to resign after your first <i>Life Thief</i> has levelled.

<u>Unhatched:</u> while the damage the <i>Unhatched</i> can do is still pretty high against Nightmares, the impact damage he resists least is distributed on several units: <i>Unhatched</i>, <i>Scornful Watcher</i> and some forms of <i>Unstable Elemental</i> all have some and can inflict painful retaliation, which leaves the <i>Black Cat</i> and <i>Floating Darkness</i> as preferred targets. It is worth though to throw the <i>Unhatched</i> on any <i>Scournful Watcher</i> around to protect your <i>Life Thief</i>.

<u>Black Cat:</u> as most of Nightmares' units have pretty low defense, getting her is not mandatory, but if the opposition is seasoned, the increase of chance to hit will be welcome. In this case, she will be in constant danger from the opposing <i>Unhatched</i>. As the jinx special does not affect unit with nightmare race (<i>Life Thief</i>, <i>Floating Darkness</i>), she will be most useful on <i>Unhatched</i> as they will not retaliate.

<u>Life Thief:</u> its arcane attack spreads panic and desolation in the ranks of opposing Nightmares. It hurts badly any unit around, getting healed in the process except against the nightmare race.  Get some of them.

<u>Scornful Watcher:</u> he is very useful to tame the <i>Life Thief</i>. None other unit can do the job better and safer than him. As being the major threat to the powerful <i>Life Thief</i> along with the <i>Life Thief</i> itself, he will be followed closely by opponent's <i>Unhatched</i> and should thus be protected by yours. If present, taking at <i>Creepers</i> never hurts.

<u>Howling Darkness:</u> the <i>Howling Darkness</i> helps reducing the impact of retaliation, saving a couple of health points that can turn death into life. However, due to its high price and lack of resilience, one of them is enough. Its cold ranged should be left for the <i>Unhatched</i> that has no resistance.

<u>Unstable Elemental:</u> in its basic tornado form, it is quite weak, and taking into account how fast is the <i>Unhatched</i> it might be hard to keep alive. Move it to forest or hill and it will trade its blade for an impact attack that will earn <i>Unhatched</i>'s respect. The bramble form gets a slow special on its range attack that comes handy against the <i>Life Thief</i>. This asset will make it the reigning form on the battlefield as the quake form's improved blade and fire resistance will have no use. 

<u>Creeper:</u> while not playing a significant role in the mirror matchup, the <i>Creepers</i> can always bring a change in strategy. Their main targets would then be the <i>Watchers</i>, the <i>Floating Darkness</i> and the <i>Black Cat</i>.
