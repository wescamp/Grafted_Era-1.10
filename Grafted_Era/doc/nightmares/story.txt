-A tale of Meloen
-Excerpt from a lesson by human mage Delfador the Great as told to young Konrad in his early years of training
-From the Archives of Galdrad, capitan of the watch in the lost South.

"...sit down boy, I want to tell you something. Maybe after that you'll stop asking why am I not using all my powers to anihilate Asheviere and her cronies. See... There are nightmares in this world, Konrad, much worse than those you sometimes have when dreaming of. They have teeth and claws, they use weapons and are cunning, and they are manyfold. Many of these were created by powerful people like me, who just also
had great power but unfortunately lacked restraint. Orcs are one example of that, but there's one much more literal, fortunately far away from us.

There was once an enchantress of significant skill named Meloen, wearing the silver robes of the questing brotherhood. Each of these wizards is individual unlike any other in the world, but all of them are united by one thing : each of them has a personal goal, something as worth aiming for as impossible as it may seem. Meloen, for reasons now long forgotten, was looking for the origins of magic. She spent years studying in libraries and wandering on the road, looking for manuscripts and magic users to interview, only to conclude, that in the end she found nothing of value to her search. In grim determination she turned to what she thought she knew about elven magic and started to meditate in a forest that looked sufficiently ancient and auspicious for mystics. That, of course, had no right to work, but by some weird coincidence or smile of fate, something amazing happened. She connected to te forest on all levels becoming something we might, to simplify things, call an avatar. She lived its life, wielded its strength and felt its pains as her own. It reflected her thoughts and mood, in its own way realised her wishes and made her dreams into flesh. Sounds impossible, doesn't it ? Yes, I agree, but there is a lesson in this for you, sometimes probabilities and logic are swept away by fate and luck often can turn even an impossible situation upside down. Never loose faith Konrad, allways follow your path, even when all seems lost.

But let us continue. Were you Meloen What would you feel ? Amusement ? Joy ? Admiration ? Amazement ? She must have felt all that, and much more. For years, as she explored her newly given life, powers and sorroundings, she was happy beyond words, and the forest itself became the most wonderful place in the world. She dreamt of a child, and she was given one. Story tells that a spirit of nature of eastern tribes called Panarbori came to her the night she concieved. But not all was as right as it looked. Here's another lesson for you boy, there can be no light without darkness, and the greater the shine the deeper the murk on its edges. Meloen, though changed, was still human in essence, and she was getting old. All people are to 
some degree afraid of dying, reasons my vary, the fear is a constant. It hadn't spared the enchantress and doubts started to creep into her mind. As wise as
she was, she didn't understand that she would die and be reborn in her child like a tree does through its sapling. And because the forest allways reflected her mood, long shadows fell in parts of it, and there were things earlier unseen lurking inside. Seeing that caused her more worry and unease, things she glimpsed in the shadows grew scarier in the bad dreams she had at night. Dreams she had at night became things of the wake next morning... There was no breaking the cycle. Not long after the forest turned into black home of the worst nightmares a man can dream of and Meloen herself went completely insane. 

That forest is still there Konrad, I have heard from travelers and merchants passing by it, allways at day, descriptions of terrible creatures seen sometimes at its edge. I think she is still trapped inside, kept alive by the all-consuming maddnes of the reality around her, making ever new nightmares each time she falls asleep. I'm also sure there is a way of saving her from the curse the gift she accidentaly found turned her into, but that is nothing you should be concerned of (...)"
