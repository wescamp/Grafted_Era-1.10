Introduction:
--------------
This era is a compilation of stand-alone factions designed for Default. It allows only one non-Default side in each game, so that two not-Default factions never meet. (all but 1 non-Default are replaced at random)

If you are interested, the reasoning behind this era is that single faction additions to Default can be ultimately better balanced against Default than multi-faction additions. On the other side, single-faction add-ons have some issues this era addresses:
All players need to download the same add-on to play. Players have to decide which faction+Default era to use. players have to choose between picking a faction before start or taking the possibility that they will play a game identical to a Default era game.

Features:
----------
-- currently 4 factions (Nightmares, Halflings, Steppe, Darklands)
-- includes a sub-era that guarantees the started game will have the side with not-Default faction.
-- Minor features:
   ---------------
   --factions have random leader selected by default (instead of a default leader: Steelclad etc.)
   --no 'special notes' for the not-default factions' units


Available eras
---------------
In the game menu, "Grafted era" works like Default with the possibility of an extra faction. "Grafted era always extra" is the same but it forces the extra faction into the game.


Determining faction options
----------------------------
Besides selecting any specific factions players can choose from: fully random, random Default and random non-Default options.

Since there are multiple limits to faction selections, some factions may have to be replaced. Random Default, random non-Default and specified factions have the same weight, but they always take precedence over basic random.


Notes:
--------------
-- Different traits: steppe goblins get the same traits as other races. Strongmen can't get the trait 'intelligent' Henchmen the trait 'resilient' and Overseers the trait 'quick'.
-- Because all 3 new factions are chaotic, the Default's 3 lawful factions have been made 1/3 more probable when rolling a random faction.
-- Because of the way the faction replacement code is written, it's impossible to play a mirror match with the non-Default factions. 
   	Minor notes:
	-------------
	-- The Nightmares faction is also available as single faction+Default era called Nightmares of Meloen. The two eras don't conflict.
	-- we are looking for help, especially with playtesting/balancing
