"About Grafted Era\n"
"-------------------\n"
"This era contains factions that are balanced against the Default era. To "
"ensure these factions don't end up being played against each other, the era "
"forces a maximum of one of these not-Default factions in every game. In "
"other words: in any game, all but one player will have Default factions.\n"
"\n"
"For more information have a look at 'readme.txt' in the era's folder.\n"
"-------------------\n"
"Contact\n"
"-------------------\n"
"you can post on the wesnoth.org forum, in era's topic found in the 'Faction "
"& Era Development' section.\n"
"you can also contact 'mystic x the unknown', preferably using wesnoth.org "
"forum private message.\n"
"-------------------\n"
"Help wanted\n"
"-------------------\n"
"If you like this era, you might also want to contribute to it. We are "
"especially in the need of playtesters and translators."

"Unlike humans or elves, most orcs find a barbaric thrill in the chaos and "
"blood of battle. Some so much so that the experience pushes their psyche, "
"unstable and violent at the best of times, dangerously close to the brink. "
"Teetering on the fine edge between sanity and burning instinct, they are "
"feared nearly as much by their comrades as by their enemies. Hurling "
"themselves bodily into the fray, they attack enemies solely with their fists "
"and teeth. Savages cease to use armour at all, allowing them greater speed "
"and ease of movement but sacrificing the protection it gives. Few have been "
"known to survive beyond early adulthood."
